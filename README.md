# Simple & Secure Password Generator üîí

A minimal, client-side password generator built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the **Web Crypto API** (`window.crypto.getRandomValues()`) to generate cryptographically strong passwords directly in your browser. No data is ever sent to a server.
